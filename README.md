# Landing-page

## What is this ?

This project is part of my **Curriculum Series**, the objective is to have a repository to prove my skills as a web developer.

Also this is my very first project ever made, the goal is to practice and consolidate my knowledge with the basics of HTML and CSS.

The Website is a simple **homepage structure**, the focus is to practice these two languages and not so much the design of the page.

## Objective

- Get practice with basic HTML elements; divs, p, span, img.
- Get practice with basic HTML attributes; id, class
- Get practice with basic CSS properties: color, text properties, background, height, margin , padding
- Understand the box model
- Put everything together to make a good looking homepage
